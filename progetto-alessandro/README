In the following, the scripts used in the master thesis are briefly described. Script labeled with * are not created by the authors. Parameters of PointNet can be freezed setting properly k value.


-->		./train_augementation.py

Training and test are performed using this file. The ouputs are weights in .pkl format, values of accuracy and loss in training and testing step

The argument to provide are number of epoch, solver, initial learning rate and decay value, the number of epoch between two tests, split of dataset, k =0,1 (freezed,not_freezed)

EXAMPLE

python train_augmentation.py --nepoch 120 --solver Nesterov --lr 0.01  --lr_gamma 0.1 --test_epochs 5 --dset split5 --k 1 --gpu 2


-->		./DECO_gpu_fix02.py

Contains the definition of the architecture

-->		./npArray.py

Generate the matrix of probability for each image

it is necessary provide the following argument for run the code --> k = 0,1 (freezed,not_freezed), model weights in *pkl format, gpu adopted, split dataset

EXAMPLE
python npArray.py --k 1 --model epoch119DECO_medium_convNesterovnot_freezed.pkl --gpu 3 --split split5

-->		./merge_pointnet.py ***

Script that computes the accuracy of AlexNet and DIP separately and the joint accuracy


it is necessary provide the following argument --> weights of AlexNet in .pkl format, matrix of probability generated by the script npArray.py, two lists of image and the number of classes

EXAMPLE

python merge_pointnet.py tmp/washington_deco_s9_depth.pkl ./np/split9/not_freezed/fc4096/pcl_np_not_freezed_split9 splits/depth_test_split_9.txt splits/depth_test_split_9.txt 51


-->		./plot.py
Script to plot the accuracy and loss value during training and test. It is necessary provide .txt with value for each row in it

EXAMPLE

python plot.py --split split0


-->		./senet.py ***

Contains definition of architecture
